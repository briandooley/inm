Chrome extension to display domain info

Installation is as follows

* Clone the master branch to a directory on your machine.
* In a Chrome browser, go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
* Press the *Load Unpacked Extension* button and select the directory where the code was cloned into.  The app details should then appear in Chrome Extensions.
* To use the extension, simply press the extensions button (or Cmd-I) in the address bar when you are in a Feedhenry or redhatmobile domain.  3 tabs will open containing the domains information as well as the Nigios and Munin pages for that domain.
