Chrome extension to display domain info

Installation is as follows

* Clone the master branch to a directory on your machine.
* In a Chrome browser, go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
* Makes sure *Developer Mode* is checked, press the *Load Unpacked Extension* button and select the directory where the code was cloned into.  The app details should then appear in Chrome Extensions.

To use the extension, simply press the extensions INM button in the address bar (or use the Cmd-I keyboard shortcut) when you are in a Feedhenry or redhatmobile studio domain.  Tabs will open containing the domains information as well as the Nagios and Munin pages relevant to that domain.
